            <h1> What do we do? </h1>
            
            <p>We started small, from univeristy project about web development. Three young teenagers who are
                euthusiatic in
                animal welfare created this website, with no other aim rather than to get
                and A+. However, this small little project became much bigger as the trio noticed that they could be on
                to
                sometime bigger, albeit not for mankind, but for mankind's friends. Pets. As Malaysians,
                we are unfortunately able to witness the sheer amount of strays on the streets. Therefore, this website
                is
                meant to be a "Tinder" for animals, for owners to find a new owner for their pets rather
                than throwing them out onto the streets. Hopefully, a small website like this can help these poor
                animals
                find a home. </p>
